# Data-Entry-Form-integrated-with-local-Excel-file-
Integrate your Own Python Form with Excel sheet using Python.

**I prefer to use Pycharm IDE**

**Installation**

**For windows users**

(run those in command prompt/cmt/terminal) For Creating a GUI-Graphic user Interface install `pip install tkinter`

To Read and Write in Excel use `pip install openpyxl`

**For linux users**

Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use `pip3`, because in linux `pip` refers for python2 and `pip3` refers to python3. Install these too - `pip3 install tkinter`

In case any error pops up install this - `pip3 install tkinter`
